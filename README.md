## The game
Based on the tower defense games, this one trades in classic paths for a more open area.

Your goal is to defend your planet from incoming asteroids and ennemies. By gathering [resources](../../wiki/Resources), you'll be able to build defensive infrastructure, and survive attack waves.

Different types of [buildings](../../wiki/Buildings) are available, such as turrets or energy production facilities. Some are placed on the planet's ground, and other in orbit. Mobiles units such as [spaceships](../../wiki/Spaceships) will also be useful to track your ennemies !
