# Planet Tower Defense
2D Game made with Unity. Build defenses around your planet, destroy asteroids and gather resources. 

## The game
Based on the tower defense games, this one trades in classic paths for a more open area.

Your goal is to defend your planet from incoming asteroids and ennemies. By gathering [resources](../../wiki/Resources), you'll be able to build defensive infrastructure, and survive attack waves.

Different types of buildings are available, such as turrets or energy production facilities. Some are placed on the planet's ground, and other in orbit.
